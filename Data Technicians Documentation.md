Tools: MySQL, Power BI

This dataset is unique, it was gathered by Alex the Analyst from 630 real employees around the world. Data was cleaned on MySQL. (Unfortunately, MySQL corrupted the file, an error during saving that resulted in empty codes when I reopened the file again). Cleaning process included:
- Unifying terms and fixing typos and mispellings like python, Python, etc.
- Adding salary bracket: <40k, 40-65k, 65k-85k, 85k-105k, 105k-125k.

Purpose of analysing this survey is to understand the current job climate within data-related industry, whether that's Data Engineering, Data Scientist, or Data Analyst. The survey reveals several important insights:
- There's a relatively low to average satisfaction level for the workers, whether it's for the salary or the work-life balance.
- The salary for men and women are relatively equal, a positive, unexpected outcome that reflects wage fairness.

The insight shows that your average data-related employee feels like things could be generally better and perhaps there are simpler ways to improve their work performance:
- Work-life balance defines their well-being that's directly tied to performance. Seek ways to improve this particularly for Data Architect and students/job-seekers.
- Attempt to provide work-life balance with salary, time-offs, breaks, and other facilities at the office (if on-site), leverage this as one of your strengths on job offers to appeal highly skilled and valuable potential candidates.
- Stick to Python infrastructure, this is the most commonly used language and will reduce training time.
