A dashboard of Bike Sales in Europe, North America, and Pacific with a simple dashboard that spotlights on the largest target market.
The findings revealed that while families and individuals of low and average income make up the biggest sales number, low-income families specifically in the North America region are highly unlikely to purchase the product compared vs. those of high-income, a unique behavior not seen in other regions such as the Pacific and Europe. The latter in face shows very similar buying percentage in both average and high-income brackets.
In the Pacific region where the minimum wage is lower, the market sees higher buying percentage within low and poverty-level income bracket.

This prompts several possibilities and deeper explorations for the potentials of expanding market into certain regions or solving the conundrum of low sales, yet high bike ownerships:
- The possible existence of long-standing competitors that has solidified their position as trusted retailer in the European area
- Average income bracket in the Pacific region might be a market that needs to be further explored
- In-depth analysis as to why lower-income bracket in the North American region doesn't own a bike may provide the solution to turn it into a profitable market, a head start in mining the new, ignored vein
